Hello,  
I'm Kafran 👋🏼🙂.

Here's a little about me:

* I have been building native apps for iOS using SwiftUI since the release of iOS 13.
* I use Go for backend development.
* Though proficient in Python, I primarily use it for data analysis.
* For web development, I prefer SSR using Tailwind CSS and HTMX.
* I'm based in João Pessoa, a vibrant city on the northeast coast of Brazil.
* My best friend and I love working on IoT projects in our spare time.
  * We use a Raspberry Pi running Linux and Go services, and
  * A BBC Microbit driven by TinyGo.
